Features page is to explain the  usage of each product and how they work alongside their capabilities
The Index page is the home page, introduing "Takion" and its purpose of selling these products
Pricing, is to explain the reason why it costs the way it costs, and the materials used in it.
Products is the page where you're able to look at the products, and different variations

Bootstrap made coding this extremely easier due to the fact that it allowd me to make hings more seamless and look better with less effort and typing.

I think I was able to follow the plan pretty well, with a few changes here and there.
